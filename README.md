A list of various (interesting and not necessarily practical) things done with neural networks. Open for suggestions and additions.

# Images

* [Neural Style Transfer](https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style) (see also [Cubist Mirror](https://github.com/genekogan/CubistMirror), an art project utilizing the style transfer; original implementation is in Torch, other variants include [TensorFlow](https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style), [Keras](https://github.com/titu1994/Neural-Style-Transfer))
* [Deep Photo Style Transfer](https://github.com/luanfujun/deep-photo-styletransfer)
* [Pix2Pix](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix) (see also [CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN) for code which makes use of Generative Adversarial Networks; original implementation is in Torch, a [TensorFlow version](https://github.com/affinelayer/pix2pix-tensorflow) is available; also take a look at the [online version](https://affinelayer.com/pixsrv/) for some nightmarish cats, weired handbags and shoes, along with building facades)
* [DeepDream](https://github.com/google/deepdream)

# Audio

* [WaveNet (Blog Post)](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/) (code: a [Fast TensorFlow implementation](https://github.com/tomlepaine/fast-wavenet), a [Keras implementation](https://github.com/basveeling/wavenet), a [TensorFlow implementation](https://github.com/ibab/tensorflow-wavenet), )
* [NSynth (Blog Post)](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/nsynth) (code available [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/nsynth); also check out this [online playable version](https://aiexperiments.withgoogle.com/sound-maker/view/))
* [Generating sound using RNNs](https://github.com/johnglover/sound-rnn)
* [Audio Style Transfer](https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/neural-style-audio-tf) (original code uses TensorFlow, other variants include [Torch](https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/neural-style-audio-torch) and [Lasagne](https://github.com/vadim-v-lebedev/audio_style_tranfer))

# Video

* [Artistic Style Transfer for Videos](https://github.com/manuelruder/artistic-videos)
